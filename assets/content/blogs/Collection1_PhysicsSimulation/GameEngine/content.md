And this is a 2d collision simualtion.

### Technical Highlights
  - Achieve a customize memory manager to optimize the resource used by the engine and the game.
  - Develop smart pointer(strong/weak) by reference counter.
  - Built basic 2D collision detection and physics.
  - Implement a messaging system to handle event trigger/callback.
