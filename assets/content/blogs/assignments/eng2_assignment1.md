####Requirement 2
Q: Tell us which projects needed to add a reference to the new Graphics project.
Did you find any projects whose code mentioned the Graphics namespace, but didn't need a reference added? If so, give an example, and explain why the code in question doesn't require a reference.

ShaderBuilder doesn't need to add a reference to Graphics project, because it only depends on the code on header files, not attach any implementation in cpp files which wrap into lib.
