#### The advantages of having human-readable asset files

In my persepective, it would facilitate user other then module developer to define object. 

In addition, it allows developer implementing totally different structure other than the user-defined interfaces. 

Besides, it is easy for developer to debug and modify the data.

#### Show one of your geometry files 
One of My geometry filies looks like

```
return {
    vertices = {{0,0,0},{1,0,0},{0,1,0},{1,1,0}},
    indices = {0,1,2,1,3,2},
}
```

I make them as a simple interface to decribe the geometry by vertices and indices.
