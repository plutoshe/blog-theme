Use W, A, S, D to move the red ball, the goal is to hit the remaining ball to the position of cube.

Use R to reset this game.

#### Review of this course

There are 4 main topics I've learned from this course, the setup of project on a solution, the platform-independent programming skills, the design of interfaces for system cooperation, the external data setting for a project. 

In my perspective, this course is teaching students how to be a eligiable engine developer, I learned these standards and methods mentioned before out of this course. And this course is well-structured. I think the knowledge taught in this course are good, but I think it is better to teach students by other ways. 

The discussion is fine, but I think the main focus should not be how to solve the assignment or the questions for this assignment. Before I reviewed this course, I cannot hold a very clear idea and image of what I get from this course. Therefore, I think the topic of every class can be more clear for students. For example, the fifth course is about the discussion of lua loading the data. It's good to make a standard letting students try this, but I think the point for this assignment is letting student try a way loading the data. Therefore, the major discussio on course should be "Is loadding data outside good?" or "The comparison between different loading data way."  I don't know whether it is the better way, but making more students understand the backbone of the engine development is crucial for this course.

By the way, I think the the discuss about how to set up a camera for graphics is kind of unnecessary for this course, I think it can be substituted with other topic. 

Except from the way, I am grateful about I learned from this course. The multithread talking is interesting, and useful for my future engineering development. The maya plugin development is beneficial for me, and I hope I can do more for it on this course.
