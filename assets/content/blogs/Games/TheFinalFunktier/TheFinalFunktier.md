The Final Fantier is an ryhthm based music game which players use a turntable-like controller and button cli moving disc and buttons to play.

The team was aggregated by the charm of moving disc controller, and made the first prototype dodging the bullets. The later 4 weeks the team tried a lot about how the game extract the funny from turntable-like controller. The core experience we proposed is about making playing rotating disc by sort of rhythm. Therefore, after comparing a lot of mechanism implemented, we use hitting beats to generate such flow.
