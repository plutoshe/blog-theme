## Astrolabe

### Introduction
Astrolabe is an moblie game where players rotate their phone to match the constellation on the sky, and then collect correponding constellation.

### Highlight
Use Gyro sensor tracking player's focus.
The algorithm about matching the player's focus and targeted constellation
Rader voice system to direct player to where the matched constellation is.
Gradual animation to amplify the feeling of gaining constellation



<!-- ###Inspiration
This prototype mainly gets the inspiration from [the momemt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP7lqWll_Qw) appearing in the “Assassin's Creed Origins” which has excellent gameplay when finding a specific constellation. And this moment drives us to explore how to advance this experience.

###Design Details
Exploration includes two parts, the seeking, and the achievement.

In the seeking phase, in the early stages for beginners, the design needs to make players getting some hints to follow, like the mountain in "Journey" and "Zelda," avoiding them getting lost. This game uses the voice radar system which gives the players immediate feedback about their movement of the phone. The closer they move towards the targeted constellation, the louder the voice responds.

In the achievement phase, this prototype uses gradual emergence and final visual/sound effect to enhance the feeling of achievement. Gives audiences several seconds to wait what they achieve in the process; it will amplify what they feel in the game.

###Review
This prototype mainly wants to understand what drives us to explore new things and make breakthroughs in different phases.

<!-- This prototype aims to provide children a chance to realize how to identify the constellations. -->

<!-- ###Personal Design Details
- Tech Deps: Unity & Mobile
- Mechanism
    - verb: Find
    - Use voice radar and living animation to make players find the constellations. 

- Emotion: Exploration & Curoisity & Achievement

- Concrete Experience:  From an empty space, fill the night sky after finding the constellations. An experience about search in unknown.

- Incentive: The effect when constellations appear and the gradual completing night sky with constellations


###Contribution
The algorithm about matching the player's focus and targeted constellation.

Create matching animation coordinated with artists.

Skybox and constellation design and settings.

voice radar design and audio system implement


###Advancement
1.The whole constellation night sky based on different seasons and locations.

2.The advanced achievement system

3.Match player's camera with the current sky. -->
